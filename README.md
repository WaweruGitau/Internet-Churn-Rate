# Internet-Churn-Rate
This project is part of the data science bootcamp by Lux Academy. I am going to analyze the churn rate at Sprint Home Internet Service. A churn is when a customer cancels their home internet subscription, switches to a competitor's service, or demonstrates a substantial drop in internet usage. 
#Data collection
I will collect historical data from clients for the following: age,gender, monthly payment,contract lenght, internet speed, data usage, customer service calls, customer service satisfaction and if the customer left or not.
